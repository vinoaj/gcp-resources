# Google Cloud for Marketing Resources

Google Cloud for Marketing refers to the art of utilising Google Cloud Platform's (GCP) data & ML capabilities to enhance marketing activities on the Google Marketing Platform (GMP). 

## Data Ingestion
- [Argon](https://github.com/google/argon): This middleware automates the import of both Campaign Manager (CM) and Display & Video 360 (DV) Offline Reporting files into BigQuery. It can be deployed onto Cloud Functions.

## Audience Activation
Resources for sending customer signals back into GMP so that you can achieve more granular targeting.

- [GMP and Google Ads Connector (aka "Tentacles")](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-for-marketing/tree/master/marketing-analytics/activation/gmp-googleads-connector) is a set of Google Cloud Platform services chained together to send audience signals (e.g. propensity to purchase score) to Google Marketing Platform targets (e.g. Google Analytics, Google Sheets, SA360, DV360, SFTP).

## Frameworks / Models
- [ML Data Windowing Pipeline solution](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-for-marketing/tree/master/marketing-analytics/predicting/ml-data-windowing-pipeline): a set of Google Cloud Dataflow pipelines, used to process Google Analytics 360 or CRM data into a Machine Learning (ML)-ready dataset. The resulting dataset will contain snapshots of dates sliding at set intervals. Each date contains a userâ€™s features based on what has happened in the past (a set lookback window respective of the date to aggregate data in), and a label based on what will happen in the future (a set prediction window respective of the date).
- [Causal Impcat model](http://google.github.io/CausalImpact/CausalImpact.html): an R package for causal inference using Bayesian structural time-series models. Use it to ask questions like "how many additional daily clicks were generated by an advertising campaign?"
- [Lifelines](https://lifelines.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): Python package, built on top of Pandas, for survival analysis. Survival analysis determines the length that a given population survives for before it dies. It can be used to identify customers' typical lifetime length with a business.
- [BigQuery ML templates](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/bigquery-ml-templates) ([supporting documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSmenfaFjKMq89s2hyESD1v8eRdkZiQspNTAkKQFoSnmEhG1KkpIRIpOEHB1anaA5rTBY5sq-izLghb/pub))
